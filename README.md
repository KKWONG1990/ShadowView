# ShadowView
ShadowView is a custom view that allows you to add shadow in your views without any hassle.
ShadowView is written in Swift language.

You just need to add shadowView class in your project.
Provide the class name in the Identity Inspector.
Once you add your class you can set the default values in ShadowView so
that if the shadow is same across multiple views you don't need to add same values again and again.
